This program implements the algorithm in "An unsupervised approach to cochannel speech separation" by 
K. Hu and D. L. Wang (submited to IEEE Trans. Audio, Speech, and Lang. Process.). This is an unsupervised
algorithm for two-speaker separation.

Execute run/seqGrp.m to start the program, which only requires a time domain cochannel speech as input

Following is a description of the main steps in seqGrp.m

1. Run a tandem algorithm (Hu & Wang'11) to estimate simultaneous streams

2. Rank simultaneous streams by time

3. Extract GFCC features (Shao'07) for each simultaneous stream

4. Perform beam search to group voiced simultaneous streams

5. Onset/offset segmentation to generate unvoiced segments

6. Group unvoiced speech
